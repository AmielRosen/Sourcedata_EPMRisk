This is the full data set from Stickling and Rosenkranz, Effects of repeated social stress on risk assessment behaviors and response to diazepam in the elevated plus maze in adult male rats.  Behav Neurosci. 2025;139(2):60-73. doi:10.1037/bne0000612

There is one file: Raw data.xlsx 

This includes separate sheets for the following data types

Weight gain: in grams

Total attacks: Total number of attacks during social defeat procedures

Time of stress exposure: Total time of attacks (in s) during social defeat procedures

Time of direct exposure x day: Total time of exposure to LE aggressor prior to separation (in s), listed separately for each day of defeat

Attack latency in s

Attack latency x day: Latency to first attack separated by each day of defeat

Distance traveled in m

Open arm time (s): Time in open arms (in s) in EPM

Closed arm preference: Calculated as (closed arm time) - (open arm time)

SAP events: Number of stretch-and-attend events

SAP time: Total time (in s) of stretch-and-attend events

Post-stretch "go": Calculated as probability of entering Open Arm after performing SAP from closed arm

Open arm preceded by SAP: Calculated as proportion of open arm entries that were immediately preceded by SAP

Rear time: Total time rearing in EPM (in s)

Rear events: Total number of rear events

Head dip time: Total time head-dipping in EPM (in s)

Each sheet contains separate columns for each condition (unless otherwise noted):

Control-Saline [Control (S)]

Stress-Saline [Stress (S)]

Control-diazepam [Control (D)]

Stress-diazepam [Stress (D)]

Each row represents a different rat assigned to one of these groups.
